        Represents a request to the other end which may be not be completed yet.
        This class is automatically created by *method* Proxy.

        Parameters:

        **conn**
            Connection instance which this Request belongs to.
            (internally stored as Request.conn)

        **request_data**
            Dictionary object to serialize as JSON to send to the other end.
            (internally stored as Request.data)


        Attributes:

        **responses**
            Queue of JSON Objects of the response, each as a dictionary. If
            no response has been received, this is empty.

        **event_response**
            A threading.Event object, which is set to true when a response has
            been received. Useful to wake up threads or to wait exactly until
            the response is received.

        **callbacks**
            List array where the developer can append functions to call when
            the response is received. The function will get the Request object
            as a first argument.

        **request_id**
            Number of ID that identifies the call. For notifications this is None.
            Be careful because it may be not an integer. Strings and other objects
            may be valid for other implementations.
